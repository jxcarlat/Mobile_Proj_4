This is a kotlin app that features a game engine. This was my final Homework Project in Mobile Applications class at UALR.
Our teacher created the game engine and had us make modifications to it in order to create an entirely new level.
I added a new sprite to the game and created an Enemy class modeled after the Player class so it could interact with the environment
like the player could. I also added a player tracking steering behavior to the enemy object and fully commented the player class as
per our assignment. Finally I modified the structure of the walls by manipulating their x and y-coordinate values, added extra
spring objects to the level, and set up a spawn location for the enemy object.
